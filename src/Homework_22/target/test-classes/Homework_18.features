Feature: Test booking page

  Background: I make preconditions for booking page
    Given I am on booking page
    When I choose city, amount of guests and rooms and click Check button
    Then I'm on page with founded hotels

  Scenario: Check hotels are present on default dates
    When I check how many hotels are present on default dates
    Then I see amount of hotels > 0
    #Examples:
     # | city  | guests | rooms |
      #| Paris | 2      | 1     |

  Scenario: Check rate of first hotel in the best hotels filter is >= 9
    When I click threedots button and choose mark plus feedbacks filter
    Then I check rate of first founded hotels is >= 9
